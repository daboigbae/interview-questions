Imagine you are creating a playlist organizer tool. 
One of the features you'd like to add is the ability 
to order a playlist based on the title's length and 
then alphabetically if there are titles with the same length.

Your task is to complete a function that:
- Accepts an array of song titles (strings).
- Orders them based on the length of the title, from shortest to longest.
- If two or more titles have the same length, it should then order them alphabetically.
- Returns the newly ordered array of song titles.

Examples

Input: ["Song", "Another Song", "Play", "A"]
Output: ["A", "Play", "Song", "Another Song"]

Input: ["A", "B", "CC", "BB", "AAA"]
Output: ["A", "B", "BB", "CC", "AAA"]

Input: ["Go", "Away", "At", "The", "Park"]
Output: ["Go", "At", "The", "Away", "Park"]

Constraints
- The input array will contain between 1 and 1000 elements.
- Each string will contain between 1 and 100 characters.
- The input array will consist only of printable ASCII characters.
