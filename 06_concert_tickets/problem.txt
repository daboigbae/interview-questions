The Concert Ticket Puzzle

Let's imagine it's Friday evening, and your favorite 
band is in town for a special concert tonight. You and 
your friends have been eagerly waiting for this day, and 
it's finally here! To make the evening more memorable, 
you have decided to buy concert tickets for your entire 
group of friends.

The venue has an interesting seating arrangement â€“ the first 
row has 5 seats, the second row has 8 seats, the third row 
has 11 seats, and so on, increasing by 3 seats in each row.

You have a certain amount of money, and you want to know 
how many rows you and your friends can sit in without running 
out of money.

Write a function concertSeats that will take two parameters:

1. budget, the amount of money you have (in dollars)
2. ticketPrice, the price of a single concert ticket (in dollars)

The function should return the number of complete rows that you 
can afford tickets for, for you and your friends.

Example:
- Input: concertSeats(100, 10)
- Output: 2

Explanation:
In this example, the seating arrangement costs for rows would be:
- 1st row: 5 * $10 = $50
- 2nd row: 8 * $10 = $80
- 3rd row: 11 * $10 = $110

With a budget of $100, you can afford the first two rows, but not 
the third one, so the function returns 2.

Constraints:
- The input budget and ticketPrice will be positive integers.
- The budget will be at most 10,000, and ticketPrice will be at most 1,000.
