Vowels are the heart of words in the English language. 
Your challenge is to write a function that takes a string 
as input and returns the total count for each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) 
in that string. The string will consist of letters and punctuation, 
and your task is to ignore anything that's not a vowel.

Example:
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: {e: 1, o: 2}

Constraints:
The input string will have at least 1 and at most 1,000 characters.
The input string consists only of printable ASCII characters.
Uppercase and lowercase vowels should be counted together.
