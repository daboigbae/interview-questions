Palindromes are words, phrases, or sequences that read the 
same backward as forward, like "level" or "madam". But what 
if we have a challenge where the objective is to find the 
longest palindromic substring within a given string?

Your task is to write a function that takes a single string 
input and returns the longest contiguous palindromic substring 
within it. If there are multiple palindromic 
substrings of the same maximum length, return any one of them.

Constraints:
The input string's length will not exceed 1,000.
The input string consists only of printable ASCII characters.

Examples:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab" (Note: "aba" is also a valid answer)

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
