For this week's challenge, we're diving into the world of prime numbers. 
Your task? To devise a function in your chosen programming language that 
generates the first n prime numbers, but presents them in reverse order.

Remember, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no 
positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers 
are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

So, if you're given n=5, your function should output: 11, 7, 5, 3, 2.
