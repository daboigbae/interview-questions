For this task, we're venturing into the realm of string manipulation. 
The challenge is to write a function that splits a string into chunks 
of n characters, then reverses each chunk.

The function should take two arguments: the string and an integer n. 
If the final chunk is not of length n, it should still be reversed.

For example, if the string is 'HelloWorld' and n is 3, the output 
should be 'leHloWrdo'.

This task may seem straightforward, but don't be deceived! It 
requires a strong understanding of how strings work and 
how to manipulate them efficiently.
