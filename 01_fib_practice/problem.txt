This week's challenge delves into the mathematically 
beautiful realm of the Fibonacci sequence, but with an 
interesting twist. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, 
involves writing a function in your preferred programming 
language that prints the Fibonacci sequence up 
to a specified number, n, but in reverse order.

Remember, the Fibonacci sequence is a series where 
each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
starting from 0 and 1. For instance: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. 

So, if you input n=5, your function should output: 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0.
